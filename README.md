# Eclipse JNoSQL Artemis
 Eclipse JNoSQL Artemis is a flexible and extensible OxM to connect NoSQL databases. It brings an easy interface to support key-value, column family, document oriented and graph databases using as base Diana in CDI based.

* CDI Based
* Diana Based
* Events to insert, delete, update
* Supports to Bean Validation
* OxM Annotation Based
* Configurable and extensible

The API's focus is on simplicity and ease of use. Developers should only have to know a minimal set of artifacts to work with the solution. The API is built on latest Java 8 features and therefore fit perfectly with the functional features of Java 8. 

The project has five modules:

* *The **artemis-core**: The Eclipse JNoSQL mapping, Artemis, commons project.
* The **artemis-configuration**: The Eclipse JNoSQL reader to Artemis project.
* The **artemis-column**: The Eclipse JNoSQL mapping, Artemis, to column NoSQL database.
* The **artemis-document**: The Eclipse JNoSQL mapping, Artemis, to document NoSQL database.
* The **artemis-key-value**: The Eclipse JNoSQL mapping, Artemis, to key-value NoSQL database.
* The **artemis-validation**: The Eclipse JNoSQL mapping, Artemis, that offers support to Bean Validation


The graph API is an extension because the communication layer to the graph is Apache TinkerPop.
