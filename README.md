# Artemis
 Artemis is a flexible and extensible ORM to connect NoSQL databases. It brings an easy interface to support key-value, column family, document oriented and graph databases using as base Diana in CDI based.

* CDI Based
* Diana Based
* Events to insert, delete, update
* Supports to Bean Validation
* ORM Annotation Based
* Configurable and extensible

The API's focus is on simplicity and ease of use. Developers should only have to know a minimal set of artifacts to work with the solution. The API is built on latest Java 8 features and therefore fit perfectly with the functional features of Java 8. 

The project has three modules:

* The artemis-column: The Eclipse JNoSQL mapping, Artemis, to column NoSQL database.
* The artemis-document: The Eclipse JNoSQL mapping, Artemis, to document NoSQL database.
* The artemis-key-value: The Eclipse JNoSQL mapping, Artemis, to key-value NoSQL database.

The graph API is an extension because the communication layer to the graph is Apache TinkerPop.
