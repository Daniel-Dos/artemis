/**
 * This package contains all Id-value domain API.
 * <p>
 * Id-value (KV) stores use the associative array (also known as a map or dictionary) as their fundamental data model.
 * In this model, data is represented as a collection of key-value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most
 * once in the collection.
 * The key-value model is one of the simplest non-trivial data models, and richer data models are often implemented
 * as an extension of it.
 * The key-value model can be extended to a discretely ordered model that maintains keys in lexicographic order.
 * This extension is computationally powerful, in that it can efficiently retrieve selective key ranges.
 * Id-value stores can use consistency models ranging from eventual consistency to serializability.
 * Some databases support ordering of keys. There are various hardware implementations, and some users maintain
 * data in memory (RAM), while others employ solid-state drives or rotating disks.
