/**
 * This package has the classes to read configuration from file, json recommended, that is normally activated from
 * {@link org.jnosql.artemis.ConfigurationUnit} annotation.
 * <p>The JSON file has the structure below:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * [
 * {
 * "description":"that is the description",
 * "name":"name",
 * "provider":"class",
 * "settings":{
 * "key":"value"
 * }
 * },
 * {
 * "description":"that is the description",
 * "name":"name-2",
 * "provider":"class",
 * "settings":{
 * "key":"value"
 * }
 * }
 * ]
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <p>Where:</p>
 * <p>Name the unit-name in the configuration, when there is more than one configuration unit (optional).</p>
 * <p>Description: the description of configuration (optional).</p>
 * <p>Provider: the class provider</p>
 * <p>settings: The key-value settings to use on the setup class.</p>
 * <p>
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * @Inject
 * @ConfigurationUnit
 * private Configuration configuration;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * When the structure just has one configuration unit the name is not required, however,
 * when there are two or more configurations the name in the configuration must match with the
 * {@link org.jnosql.artemis.ConfigurationUnit#name()} annotation.
 * When the structure just has one configuration unit the name is not required, however,
 * when there are two or more settings the name in the configuration must match with the annotation.
 * If there are more than two configurations in the file and the inject does not inform the name that will
 * throw an exception.
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * @Inject
 * @ConfigurationUnit(name = "name")
 * private Configuration configuration;
 * }
 * </pre>
